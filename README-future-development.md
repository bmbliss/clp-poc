# A220 CLP: Future Development Roadmap

This document outlines prioritized enhancements for the Airbus A220 Central Load Planning (CLP) Proof of Concept, organized by implementation priority, expected impact, and complexity.

## Priority 1: Essential Enhancements (High Impact, Moderate Effort)

These improvements would significantly increase the accuracy and usefulness of the CLP tool with reasonable implementation effort:

### 1. Proper CG Envelope Visualization

**Current State:** Simple horizontal min/max CG limits regardless of weight.  
**Enhancement:** Implement a proper CG envelope graph showing how forward and aft limits vary with aircraft weight.  
**Implementation:**
- Replace the current line chart with a true envelope plot
- Show weight on Y-axis, CG on X-axis
- Plot the current W&B point within the envelope
- Add colored regions for normal operations vs. caution zones

**Impact:** Much better visualization of safety margins and operational flexibility.

### 2. MAC (Mean Aerodynamic Chord) View

**Current State:** CG shown only in absolute units (feet).  
**Enhancement:** Add ability to toggle between absolute (feet) and relative (%MAC) CG display.  
**Implementation:**
- Add conversion functions between feet and %MAC
- Include toggle control in the UI
- Show both values in critical displays
- Update the visualization to support both viewing modes

**Impact:** Aligns with industry-standard CG representation and pilot familiarity.

### 3. Improved Fuel Burn Profile

**Current State:** Simple 75% fuel burn estimate for landing weight.  
**Enhancement:** More sophisticated fuel burn model based on flight duration, route, and aircraft type.  
**Implementation:**
- Add flight duration input field
- Implement burn rate profiles (takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach)
- Calculate landing weight with phase-specific fuel burns
- Add margin for holding fuel and contingencies

**Impact:** More accurate landing weight estimates and better safety assessments.

### 4. Visual Seat Map

**Current State:** Abstract zone-based passenger input.  
**Enhancement:** Visual seat map showing actual A220 cabin layout for passenger assignment.  
**Implementation:**
- Create interactive 2-3 seating layout graphic matching A220 configuration
- Allow clicking to assign passengers with different weights
- Calculate zone weights dynamically based on seat assignments
- Retain simplified zone input as an alternative

**Impact:** More intuitive interface and precise CG calculations.

## Priority 2: Operational Improvements (High Impact, Higher Effort)

These features would make the tool more practical for daily airline operations:

### 5. PDF Load Sheet Export

**Current State:** Results shown only on screen.  
**Enhancement:** Generate industry-standard load sheet PDFs for operational use.  
**Implementation:**
- Create PDF template matching industry standards
- Add functionality to generate and download load sheet
- Include all required operational fields and signatures
- Format to match existing operational documents

**Impact:** Bridge to operational use by providing standard documentation.

### 6. Data Persistence

**Current State:** No ability to save configurations or flight plans.  
**Enhancement:** Save, load, and reuse aircraft configurations and flight plans.  
**Implementation:**
- Add database or file-based storage for configurations
- Create save/load UI controls
- Allow template creation for common routes/aircraft
- Add flight identification fields

**Impact:** Reduces repetitive data entry and enables historical analysis.

### 7. Cargo Distribution Management

**Current State:** Only passenger bags considered.  
**Enhancement:** Add cargo loading capability with multiple positions and special loads.  
**Implementation:**
- Add cargo positions with arms and weight limits
- Support special cargo types (hazardous, live animals, etc.)
- Calculate impact on total weight and CG
- Implement cargo loading optimization

**Impact:** Complete weight and balance solution covering all payload types.

### 8. What-If Scenario Comparison

**Current State:** Single loading scenario at a time.  
**Enhancement:** Compare multiple loading scenarios side by side.  
**Implementation:**
- Allow saving scenarios within a session
- Create side-by-side or tabular comparison view
- Highlight differences between scenarios
- Recommend optimal scenario based on fuel efficiency

**Impact:** Better decision support for load planning optimization.

## Priority 3: Advanced Features (Medium Impact, Higher Complexity)

These features add significant capabilities but require more complex implementation:

### 9. Takeoff Performance Calculations

**Current State:** No performance calculations.  
**Enhancement:** Basic takeoff distance calculations based on weight, temperature, and runway conditions.  
**Implementation:**
- Add environmental inputs (temperature, pressure altitude, wind)
- Add runway parameters (length, slope, surface condition)
- Implement simplified performance model for A220
- Show runway required vs. available with safety margins

**Impact:** Adds critical operational capability related to weight limits.

### 10. Weather Integration

**Current State:** No environmental data consideration.  
**Enhancement:** Integration with weather API for actual conditions at departure/arrival.  
**Implementation:**
- Connect to aviation weather API (METAR/TAF)
- Pull temperature, pressure, wind for relevant airports
- Automatically update performance calculations
- Show weather-related restrictions

**Impact:** Real-time environmental factors for more accurate planning.

### 11. Trim Curve Visualization

**Current State:** Simple stabilizer trim lookup table.  
**Enhancement:** Interactive trim curve visualization showing relationship between CG, weight, and trim setting.  
**Implementation:**
- Create 2D or 3D visualization of trim curves
- Show how trim setting changes with weight and CG
- Allow interactive exploration of the relationship
- Include takeoff and landing trim differences

**Impact:** Better understanding of trim effects and improved educational value.

### 12. Comprehensive Documentation Section

**Current State:** Basic explanatory notes.  
**Enhancement:** Detailed, embedded documentation with physics principles and calculations.  
**Implementation:**
- Create comprehensive educational content
- Add diagrams explaining aerodynamic principles
- Include walkthrough tutorials for key concepts
- Provide reference information for operational use

**Impact:** Enhanced educational value and better user understanding.

## Implementation Strategy

## Success Metrics

Measure the impact of these improvements through:
1. **Accuracy**: Compare CLP results with actual flight data
2. **Usability**: User testing with load planning staff
3. **Efficiency**: Time saved vs. current third-party solutions
4. **Adoption**: Frequency of tool use for flight planning
5. **Fuel Savings**: Measured impact of CG optimization on fuel burn

## Data Requirements

The following real A220 data will be needed:
- Complete Weight & Balance Manual data
- Detailed seat and cargo position arm values
- Performance charts from Flight Crew Operating Manual
- Actual fuel burn profiles from flight operations
- Standard load sheet formats used by operations

By following this development roadmap, the CLP PoC can evolve from a demonstration tool into a production-ready system capable of supporting daily A220 operations.
